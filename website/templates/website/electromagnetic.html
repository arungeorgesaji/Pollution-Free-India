  <h1>How ElectroMagnetic Pollution occurs?</h1>
  <p style="font-size: larger; word-spacing: 10%; margin: 9px">
    Electromagnetic pollution, also known as electromagnetic interference (EMI) or
    radio frequency interference (RFI), occurs when electromagnetic waves from
    various sources interfere with each other or with electrical equipment. This
    can happen due to a variety of sources, including power lines, cell phone
    towers, radio and television transmitters, and electronic devices such as
    computers and microwaves. Electromagnetic pollution can also occur as a result
    of natural phenomena such as lightning.

  <h1 style>How can one prevent it?</h1>
  <p style="font-size: larger; margin: 9px">
    There are several ways to prevent or reduce electromagnetic pollution (EMI) or
    radio frequency interference (RFI) in your home or office. Here are a few
    methods: Keep electronic devices away from each other: Try to separate
    electronic devices that may cause interference, such as a computer and a
    microwave oven. Use shielded cables: Use shielded cables for electronic
    devices that are sensitive to EMI, such as audio equipment. Use a surge
    protector: Use a surge protector to protect your electronic devices from power
    surges and voltage spikes. Use EMI filters: Use EMI filters on electrical
    outlets to reduce electromagnetic interference from entering your home. Turn
    off electronic devices when not in use: Turning off electronic devices when
    not in use can reduce the amount of electromagnetic pollution in your home.
    Create a Faraday cage: A Faraday cage is an enclosure made of a conducting
    material such as metal, which blocks electric fields. Use of specialized
    paints and curtains: There are specialized paint and curtains available that
    can block electromagnetic waves to a certain degree, they are not very
    effective but may help. It is important to note that complete elimination of
    electromagnetic pollution is difficult, but following these steps can help
    reduce your exposure to it.

    What all measures can one take if their area is affected by ElectroMagnetic
    pollution?
  </h1>
  <p style="margin: 9px; font-size: larger">
    If you live or work in an area that is affected by electromagnetic
    interference (EMI) or radio frequency interference (RFI), there are several
    measures you can take to reduce your exposure to the pollution: Shielding: Use
    shielding materials such as metal mesh or conductive paint to block
    electromagnetic waves from entering your home or office. Distance: Keep
    electronic devices and appliances away from areas where you spend a lot of
    time, such as your bedroom or work area. Filters: Use EMI filters on
    electrical outlets and on the incoming cable or antenna lines. Grounding: Make
    sure that all electronic devices and appliances are properly grounded to
    reduce interference. Turn off devices when not in use: Turning off electronic
    devices and appliances when not in use can reduce the amount of
    electromagnetic pollution in your home or office. Faraday cage: Use a Faraday
    cage to block electromagnetic waves from entering a specific room or area. Use
    of specialized paint and curtains: There are specialized paint and curtains
    available that can block electromagnetic waves to a certain degree, they are
    not very effective but may help. Contact authorities: If the EMI pollution is
    caused by a specific source, such as a nearby cell phone tower or power
    substation, you can contact the authorities and request that they take
    measures to reduce the pollution. It's also worth noting that it's important
    to consult with a professional to determine the best course of action as the
    intensity and frequency of EMI pollution can vary greatly depending on the
    location and source.
