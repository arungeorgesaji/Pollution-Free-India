<h1>How Litter Pollution occurs?</h1>
<p style="font-size: larger; word-spacing: 10%; margin: 9px">
  Litter pollution occurs when solid waste, including trash, debris, and other
  forms of refuse, are not disposed of properly and end up in the environment.
  This can happen due to a variety of factors, including: Improper disposal:
  When people do not properly dispose of their waste, it can end up as litter in
  the environment. Littering: When people intentionally throw trash on the
  ground, it can contribute to litter pollution. Natural Disasters: Storms,
  floods, and other natural disasters can cause waste and debris to be scattered
  in the environment. Improper waste management: When waste management systems
  are not functioning properly, it can lead to litter being scattered in the
  environment. Marine litter: Litter pollution can also occur in the ocean and
  other bodies of water, where it can harm marine life and damage ecosystems.
  Litter pollution can have negative effects on both human health and the
  environment. It can attract pests, such as rodents and insects, and can harm
  wildlife that may ingest or become entangled in the litter. It can also create
  an unsightly and unpleasant environment, and it can be costly to clean up. To
  prevent litter pollution, it's important to properly dispose of waste, recycle
  when possible, and to take personal responsibility for not littering. Also,
  supporting anti-litter campaigns, supporting laws and regulations that
  prohibit litter and encouraging others to do the same can go a long way in
  preventing litter pollution.

  litter. Support anti-litter campaigns: Support anti-litter campaigns and
  organizations that work to keep communities clean. Support laws and

  efforts, such as beach clean-ups or litter pick-ups in your community. Support
  proper waste management: Support proper waste management by promoting
  recycling and composting, and by supporting policies that encourage

  cutlery, that can become litter easily. Support marine litter management:
  Support proper management of marine litter by reducing the use of single-use
  plastics, supporting laws and regulations and participating in clean-up
